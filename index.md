		<h3>Week 9 (Oct 29th 2019)</h3> 
		<p>This week when I gave my demo in class I had to give it on a raspberry Pi 3 and when I came home and tried run the code on my Raspberry Pi zero, The Raspberry Pi Zero crashed did not turn back on. I tried alot to search the meaning of this and everywhere it told me that my raspberry Pi Zero had died. So to resolve this issue I decided to order a raspberry Pi 3 this time, and it cam in the second day. I have made an update to my budget and now back on track with my project in terms of the project working as well as finacially.</p>
